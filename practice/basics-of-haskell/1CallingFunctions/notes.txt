This section introduced syntax for calling functions, which by this 
point I am familiar with.

Then went on to precedence wrt function application. 
KEY: Function application has the highest precedence.
a b * c d is equivalent to (a b) * (c d)

TODO: Find the precedence documentation
http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch4.html#x10-820004.4.2

Dollar and Dot Notation
KEY: $ has the lowest precedence
KEY: $ binds to the right

KEY: . is function composition
KEY: id is a function that just returns its argument
