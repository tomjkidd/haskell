KEY: Partial means that a function is not defined for all values of 
possible arguments. Contrasted with total.

Maybe and Either are often used in this capacity.

data Either a b = Left a | Right b
This data type is parameterized by 2 types.
Left encodes failure (usually as a String) while Right encodes success.
