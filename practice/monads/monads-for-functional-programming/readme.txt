Philip Wadler's 'Monads for functional programming' paper presented 
some context for understanding monads through Haskell.

I wanted to act as a witness to the code presented in that paper...

Pure languages are lambda calculus pure and simple.
Impure languages augment lambda calculus with a number of possible effects, such as assignment, exceptions, or continuations.

Monads, from category theory, can be used to integrate impure effects into pure functional languages.

Wadler makes a point that "It is doubtful that the structuring methods presented here would have been discovered without the insight afforded by category theory. But once discovered they are easily expressed without any reference to things categorical. No knowledge of category theory is required to read these notes."
